# Latent-Space Genetic Algorithm with SVD Projection

This repository provides an implementation of a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** that operates in a **low-dimensional latent space**, which is derived from a high-dimensional input space using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**. The framework optimizes various benchmark functions efficiently by leveraging dimensionality reduction, improving search performance and convergence in high-dimensional optimization problems.
