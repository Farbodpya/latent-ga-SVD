# Latent-Space Genetic Algorithm with SVD Projection

This project implements a genetic algorithm that operates in a low-dimensional latent space, projected from a high-dimensional input space using SVD. It supports optimization of various benchmark functions.

## Features

- SVD-based dimensionality reduction
- Genetic operators: blend crossover, mutation
- Dynamic population size
- Benchmark suite: Sphere, Rastrigin, Ackley, Griewank, Zakharov, Rastrigin II
- Performance visualization
